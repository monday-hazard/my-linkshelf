# 📚 My linkshelf

Some wonder if the web is made by developers for the sole purpose of being the best place for developers. I would tend to answer 🤔 :

***Well no, but actually yes.*** ✨

👉 Here are some links about web development I was lucky to come across and I humbly gathered in my linkshelf.

***

## 🤖 Javascript

📰 Lydia Hallie's brilliant series [JavaScript visualized](https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif). The JavaScript Envent Loop, the JavaScript Engine, promises and other **JS core concepts visually explained**.

🎬 [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) : the first 3.5 hours of a nice course.

***

## 🔋 Node
👾 A curated list of [Node Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)

***
## 🎨 CSS

🎬 [Why is CSS So Weird ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUtMbJw8iA) Miriam Suzanne explains why and it totally makes sense (... but doesn't solve my problems).

***
## 🩻 Cross-tech concepts

⌨️ Everything one needs to know about patterns : [patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/posts) (the brillant Lydia Hallie again 🫶, along with some other partners in crime)

📰 Everything about front-end performance : [Front-End performance checklist - 2021](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/front-end-performance-2021-free-pdf-checklist/)

⌨️ Explaining some development basics to beginners by [analogies](https://www.codeanalogies.com/). A reminder that 'Web Development Is Hard' and this is how EVERYTHING should be explained. (special thoughts for 'Props/State Explained Through Darth Vader’s Hunt for the Rebels' that helped me a lot at the time).

## 🌱 Eco-design

🧙‍♀️ LE [RGESN](https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-general-ecoconception/)

👾 [115 web eco-design best practices](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices) : the name says it all, except that the content is in French 🥖

🛠 [PAGIEL](https://github.com/Zenika/pagiel) : an interesting tool (Automated Platform for Generating Environmental Indicators on Software) (in 🥖 too).

***
## 🌈 Inclusive tech

⌨️ [Gender and UI/UX Design](https://uxetgenre.notion.site/uxetgenre/Guide-pratique-sur-la-diversit-de-genre-en-design-UX-UI-5ebd7996fca54a458d10a616ca10c211)

📼 [La diversité de genre dans le logiciel libre](https://www.libreavous.org/147-la-diversite-de-genre-dans-le-logiciel-libre-logiciel-libre-outil-convivial), a podcast (in 🥖) with the great Isabelle Collet 🫶
